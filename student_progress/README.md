## How to Use This System

### Tracking Progress
1. The `progress_overview.md` file serves as the main dashboard for tracking overall progress
2. Individual module progress is tracked in separate files under `module_progress/`
3. Each module progress file contains:
   - Activity checklist
   - Completed exercises
   - Notes and observations
   - Areas for review

### Recording Meetings
1. Create a new file in `meeting_notes/` for each meeting using the format: `YYYY-MM-DD_meeting.md`
2. Follow the meeting notes template to record:
   - Topics discussed
   - Progress review
   - Action items
   - Next steps

### Updating Progress
1. Update `progress_overview.md` after completing activities or meetings
2. Mark completed items in the relevant module progress file
3. Add detailed notes and observations as needed
4. Record any challenges or questions for discussion

## Templates
- Use the existing templates in each directory as a base for new files
- Maintain consistent formatting for easy tracking and review
- Include dates with all updates and entries

## Best Practices
1. Update progress regularly
2. Be specific in progress notes
3. Include both achievements and challenges
4. Link to relevant resources or materials
5. Keep meeting notes focused and actionable
